# Why do you need Tensorflow?

By Samyak Sarnayak



## Before we start


Pre-requisites:
 - basic math - be ready to open Google :)
 - ~PhD in physics~


Questions:
 - related questions or you don't follow - interrupt anytime.
 - not-so-related questions - I'll try to answer these at the end.

I'm not an expert, if you feel something is wrong or different, pls do tell


Let's go


Our friend Teefie

Teefie goes to school everyday

<!-- TODO: images -->


in a car

<!-- TODO: images -->


The school is `$10$` kms away


Teefie took 2 hours to reach school one day

What was his average speed?


`$$ avg.\ speed = \frac{distance}{time} $$`


`$$ avg.\ speed = \frac{10 km}{2 hours} = 5 km/hr $$`


Yeah, Teefie is a little slow üê¢


But what's the point?


Now that we know Teefie's average speed

We can guess how long he'll take to travel `$20$` kms


or any other distance.



That was simple


But let's assume for a moment


That we don't know physics


Or it's something extreeeemely complex


That doesn't stop us

We still want the average speed


Somehow



Let's guess it


Given `$ 10 $` kms and 2 hours to reach

I'll say the average speed is 10km/hr


That's not quite right, but how do you know?


How should you correct this?


Fortunately we're in an ideal world


There's an **Oracle** that can tell you how far you are from the right answer.


The **Oracle** tells you that you are `$ 25 $` away from the answer.

## How would you reach the correct answer?

Remember:
 - You give **The Oracle** a guess and they tell you far away you are from the correct answer
 - You can ask **The Oracle** as many times as you want



An efficient trick


 - Nudge the guess by a bit, say `$ 10.1 $`


 - Oracle says `$ 26 $` now

 (remember it was `$ 25 $`)


 - Now you know which direction to go


 - You say 9, Oracle says 16


 - You say 8, Oracle says 9


 - You say 6, Oracle says 1


 - You say 4, Oracle says 1


 - Oops you overshot the answer


 - You say 5, Oracle says 0


 - You got it üéâ



This is how it looks when you plot it

### What even was this?


The Oracle is commonly known as the **cost function** or loss function.

Something that tells you how far away you are from the answer.


That process of gradually arriving at the answer based on the cost function is called **Gradient Descent**


This thing
<sub>
 - Nudge the guess by a bit, say `$ 10.1 $`
 - Oracle says `$ 26 $` now
</sub>

is **differentiation**


This is how a neural network works, on a very basic level.
